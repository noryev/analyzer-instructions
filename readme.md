Creating a CSV file like the one you described involves listing URLs and corresponding identifiers in a comma-separated format. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create such a file:

1. **Prepare Data**: Gather all the URLs and their corresponding identifiers (numbers in your case) that you wish to include in the CSV file.

2. **Choose a Text Editor or Spreadsheet Program**: You can use a basic text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac), or a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

3. **Format the Data**: Arrange the data in two columns:
    - The first column should contain the URLs.
    - The second column should contain the corresponding identifiers (numbers).

4. **Entering Data in a Text Editor**:
    - Open your text editor.
    - Enter the data in the format `URL,identifier,`, with each entry on a new line. 
    - For example:
      ```
      https://bafybeicbhh6jitezdcozi4lgjnivgsdvmbmstyyj6cqxmoqcq7xklyngxu.ipfs.w3s.link/doitforrey.png,0,

      ```
    - Continue this format for all your entries.

5. **Entering Data in a Spreadsheet Program**:
    - Open your spreadsheet program and start a new document.
    - Enter each URL in the first column (A) and its corresponding identifier in the second column (B).
    - Your spreadsheet will look like this:
      | A                                                         | B |
      | --------------------------------------------------------- | - |

      | ...                                                       | ... |

6. **Saving the File**:
    - If using a text editor, simply save the file with a `.csv` extension, for example, `analysis_data.csv`.
    - If using a spreadsheet program:
      - Go to `File` > `Save As`.
      - Choose the location to save the file.
      - Enter a file name, ensuring it ends in `.csv` (e.g., `analysis_data.csv`).
      - In the 'Save as type' dropdown, select `CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`.
      - Click `Save`.
      - If prompted about keeping the workbook in this format, confirm your choice.

7. **Final Check**: After saving the file, it's a good idea to reopen it in a text editor to ensure that the data is correctly formatted as CSV.

Now your CSV file is ready to use. This file format is widely used and should be compatible with most systems and software designed to handle CSV data.

8. Upload CSV file to Leto for scanning!
